Web Infrastructure Design

   1. User types www.foobar.com in the browser.

   2. DNS resolution:

    The domain name www.foobar.com is resolved by DNS.

    The www is a DNS A record that points to server IP: 8.8.8.8.

   3. HTTP/HTTPS request:

    The browser sends a request to 8.8.8.8 via HTTP/HTTPS over TCP/IP.

    4. Nginx Web Server (on the server):

    The web server (Nginx) listens on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).

    It forwards the request to the application server.

    5. Application Server:

    This runs the backend code (e.g. Python, PHP, Node.js).

    It processes the request (like fetching user profiles, handling forms, etc.).

    6. Database (MySQL):

    The application server communicates with MySQL database to retrieve or store data.

    7. Response:

    The application server sends the processed response (like HTML, JSON) back to Nginx.

    Nginx sends it back to the user’s browser.

    User’s browser displays the website.
